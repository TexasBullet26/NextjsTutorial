*A Small Tutorial on Setting-Up Next.js*

### What Is Next.js

Think about how apps are created with PHP. You create some files, write PHP code, then you deploy it. No worrying about routing that much, and the app is rendered on the server by default.

That's what [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js) does, but instead of PHP, Next build the app with JavaScript and React. Here are some of the other cool features Next.js brings us:
  - Server-rendered by default
  - Automatic code splitting for faster page loads
  - Simple client-side routing (page based)
  - Webpack-based dev environment which supports [Hot Module Replacement](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/hot-module-replacement/) (HMR)
  - Able to implement with Express or any other Node.js HTTP Server
  - Customizable with your own Babel and Webpack configurations
